# Sentry Workflows

Debug production issues and maintain code quality with Sentry context. This page helps you find the right workflow skill for your task.

## How to Fetch Skills

Use `curl` to download skills — they are 10–20 KB files that fetch tools often summarize, losing critical details.

    curl -sL https://skills.sentry.dev/sentry-fix-issues/SKILL.md

Append the path from the `Path` column in the table below to `https://skills.sentry.dev/`. Do not guess or shorten URLs.

## Start Here — Read This Before Doing Anything

**Do not skip this section.** Do not assume which workflow the user needs. Ask first.

1. If the user mentions **fixing errors, debugging exceptions, or investigating production issues** → `sentry-fix-issues`
2. If the user mentions **Sentry bot comments or `sentry[bot]` on a PR** → `sentry-code-review`
3. If the user mentions **Seer, bug prediction, or reviewing PRs for predicted issues** → `sentry-pr-code-review`
4. If the user mentions **upgrading Sentry, migrating SDK versions, or fixing deprecated APIs** → `sentry-sdk-upgrade`

When unclear, **ask the user** whether the task involves live production issues, PR review comments, or SDK upgrades. Do not guess.
