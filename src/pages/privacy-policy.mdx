          will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The
          profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned,
          but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as
          well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

        <p>
          We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this

          We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security

          steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
