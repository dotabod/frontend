## Cryptocurrency Payments Now Available

We're excited to announce that Dotabod now supports cryptocurrency payments for all Pro subscriptions! This highly-requested feature allows our users to pay for their Dotabod Pro subscriptions using their preferred cryptocurrencies.

### What This Means For You

Starting today, you'll see a new payment option in our subscription checkout process that lets you:

- Pay with popular cryptocurrencies
- Choose between monthly, annual, or lifetime subscription plans
- Manage your crypto subscriptions directly from your dashboard
- Receive renewal invoices for upcoming payments

### How It Works

When subscribing to Dotabod Pro, you'll now see a "Pay with Crypto" toggle in the checkout process. Simply enable this option to access our cryptocurrency payment flow.

The process is straightforward:

1. Select your preferred subscription plan (monthly, annual, or lifetime)
2. Toggle the "Pay with Crypto" option
3. Complete the checkout process
4. Pay the invoice using your preferred cryptocurrency
5. Your Pro subscription is activated immediately

For renewal payments, you'll receive an invoice 7 days before your subscription period ends, giving you plenty of time to make your next payment.

### Important Notes

- Cryptocurrency payments do not support automatic renewals - you'll need to manually pay each renewal invoice
- The free trial period is not available with crypto payments
- Lifetime plans are available with a single crypto payment
- All transactions are securely processed through our payment provider

### Why We Added Crypto Payments

We believe in giving our users choices in how they pay for Dotabod Pro. Many of our community members are cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and we're happy to support this payment option to make Dotabod more accessible to everyone.

Additionally, we understand that many users in certain countries face restrictions with traditional payment methods. Cryptocurrency payments provide an alternative solution, ensuring that Dotabod Pro is accessible to our global community regardless of local financial limitations.
