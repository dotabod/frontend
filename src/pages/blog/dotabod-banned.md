## Important Service Announcement

We want to inform our community that Dotabod is currently experiencing a temporary service disruption. On March 30, 2025, our Twitch bot received a 7-day suspension for inadvertently displaying inappropriate content. This suspension will end on April 6, 2025.

### What Happened?

During a stream, our Notable Players feature (!nps command) displayed player names without filtering. Unfortunately, one of the displayed names contained a hateful slur in Russian. This automatic display of uncensored player information resulted in our service being flagged for "Hateful Slurs or Symbols" by Twitch.

### How This Affects You

If you're a Dotabod user, you may notice:

- The Twitch bot is currently unavailable
- Some overlay features may not be functioning properly
- Your dashboard access remains available

### What We're Doing About It

We've taken immediate action to address this issue:

1. **Temporary Solution**: We've enabled a basic version of the overlay that will continue functioning without the bot
2. **Content Filtering**: We're implementing robust filtering for player names and chat content
3. **Service Restoration**: Full service will automatically resume on April 6, 2025

### Next Steps for Users

If your overlay stopped working:

1. Visit your [Dotabod dashboard](https://dotabod.com/dashboard)
2. Re-enable Dotabod from the settings
3. Note that when Dotabod returns, it may need to be re-modded in your channel

### Our Commitment to Safety

We sincerely apologize for this disruption. We're committed to creating a safe, inclusive environment and are taking this opportunity to strengthen our content filtering systems. This incident has highlighted an important area for improvement, and we're working diligently to prevent similar issues in the future.

Thank you for your patience and understanding during this temporary disruption. If you have any questions or concerns, please join our [Discord community](https://discord.dotabod.com) for the latest updates and support.
