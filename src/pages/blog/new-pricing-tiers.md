Hey streamers! Since day one, Dotabod's been free for everyone—and we've loved watching our 22,000-strong community grow. But to keep pushing the boundaries of Dota 2 streaming (think slicker automation, pro-grade overlays, and more), we're rolling out new pricing plans on April 30, 2025.

Here's the scoop:

- **Free Plan ($0):** Perfect for casual streamers. You'll get multi-language support, basic minimap blockers, essential commands (!mmr, !wl), and more. No cost, no catch—just solid streaming basics.
- **Pro Plan ($6/month):** Built for the grinders. Unlock automated setups (Dota 2, OBS, Twitch), win probability overlays, Roshan timers, and early access to beta features. It's everything you need to stand out.
- **Lifetime ($99):** Pay once, use forever. Get all current and future features, updates, and support.

Until April 30, everyone gets full access to all features—Free *and* Pro. Test the goods, see what fits, and pick your plan.

Why the change? Building and maintaining Dotabod takes time and resources. Going free got us here, but Pro subscriptions will fuel the next level—more updates, better support, and features you'll love.

Got questions? Hit up our chat on dotabod.com or check the [FAQ](http://localhost:3000/#faqs). You can also view our [pricing details](http://localhost:3000/#pricing) for more information. Let's keep making your streams legendary!
