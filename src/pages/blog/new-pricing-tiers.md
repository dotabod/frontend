Since Dotabod launched, we've proudly provided everything free for over 22,000 passionate Dota 2 streamers. Watching this community flourish has been amazing—but to level up and sustain growth, we're introducing new pricing tiers starting **April 30, 2025**.

### Here’s what the new plans look like

- **Free Plan ($0/month)**
  Ideal for casual streamers, this tier gives you essential tools: multi-language support, basic minimap blockers, core chat commands (!mmr, !wl), and everything you need for effortless streaming.

- **Pro Plan ($6/month)**
  Designed for streamers ready to turn passion into growth. Unlock powerful automation (OBS/Twitch integrations), dynamic overlays like Roshan timers and win-probability displays, plus early access to new beta features. This is your ticket to a pro-level streaming experience.

- **Lifetime Plan ($99 one-time payment)**
  Pay once, stream forever. Lifetime access includes all current and future features, regular updates, and ongoing support, letting you permanently secure your streaming toolkit.

From today until April 30, everyone gets complete access to all features—both Free and Pro. Try it out, explore what's possible, and confidently pick the plan that's best for you.

### Why introduce pricing?

Dotabod is proudly open-source (see our work on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotabod)). As a solo developer, I've spent countless hours coding, debugging, and introducing new features. While the code will always remain free and self-hostable, hosting infrastructure at scale comes at a cost. Moving to a sustainable model ensures Dotabod thrives long-term, benefiting every streamer who relies on our tools.

Your support directly funds infrastructure, innovation, and the resources necessary to maintain Dotabod's high standards. Thanks for being a vital part of our community!

Together, let's continue making streaming extraordinary.
