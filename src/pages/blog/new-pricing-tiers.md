Hey streamers! Since day one, Dotabod's been free for everyone—and we've loved watching our 22,000-strong community grow together like a family. But to keep pushing the boundaries of Dota 2 streaming (think slicker automation, pro-grade overlays, and more), we're rolling out new pricing plans on April 30, 2025.

Here's the scoop:

- **Free Plan ($0):** Perfect for casual streamers. You'll get multi-language support, basic minimap blockers, essential commands (!mmr, !wl), and more. No cost, no catch—just solid streaming basics to keep your passion alive.
- **Pro Plan ($6/month):** Built for the grinders chasing their streaming dreams. Unlock automated setups (Dota 2, OBS, Twitch), win probability overlays, Roshan timers, and early access to beta features. It's everything you need to stand out and create those unforgettable moments with your viewers.
- **Lifetime ($99):** Pay once, use forever. Get all current and future features, updates, and support—become part of Dotabod's legacy.

Until April 30, everyone gets full access to all features—Free *and* Pro. Test the goods, see what fits, and pick your plan. We want you to feel confident in your choice.

Why the change? As you might know, Dotabod is completely open-source (check us out at [github.com/dotabod](https://github.com/dotabod)). I've been pouring my heart and soul into it as a solo developer—late nights maintaining the codebase, fixing bugs, introducing new features, and collaborating with top streamers to make it better. While the project will always remain open-source, and you're absolutely free to self-host it if you prefer, the new pricing will help cover the infrastructure costs needed to host and maintain Dotabod for thousands of streamers who've become part of our journey.

Building and maintaining Dotabod isn't just work—it's a labor of love that takes significant time and resources. Going free got us here, but Pro subscriptions will fuel the next level—more updates, better support, and features you'll love. Your support means everything to keeping this dream alive.
