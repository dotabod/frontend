To create a cheaper pricing strategy with a Free tier, a $3.99 tier, and a $6.99 tier for Dotabod, we‚Äôll need to carefully segment the features to provide value at each level while keeping the paid tiers attractive enough to encourage upgrades. The Free tier will serve as an entry point to hook users, while the paid tiers will unlock progressively more functionality tailored to Dota 2 streamers. Here‚Äôs the revised pricing strategy:

---

### Pricing Strategy Considerations
1. **Free Tier**: Must offer enough value to attract users but limit advanced features to incentivize upgrades. Competitors like Nightbot and Moobot offer free basic bots, so Dotabod‚Äôs Free tier should include minimal Dota 2-specific features.
2. **Low Price Points**: $3.99 and $6.99 are very affordable, aligning with microtransaction-style pricing (e.g., Twitch‚Äôs Bits or small Patreon tiers). Features must be scaled down to fit these budgets while remaining profitable.
3. **Target Audience**: Free for casual testers, $3.99 for small streamers, $6.99 for serious hobbyists or semi-pros.
4. **Scalability**: Keep server-heavy features (e.g., win probability, OBS scene switching) in higher tiers to manage costs.

### Proposed Pricing Tiers

#### Tier 1: Free - $0/month
**Target Audience**: New users, casual streamers, or those testing Dotabod.

**Features Included**:
- **Setup**: Manual setup only (no automation).
- **Main Features**:
  - Multi-language support (English only).
- **Overlay Features**:
  - Minimap: Enable minimap blocker (basic semi-transparent blocker, no customization).
- **Chat Features**:

  - Utility: `!commands`, `!dotabod`.

**Limitations**:

- Basic chat responses only (no item/hero-specific messages).

**Rationale**: The Free tier offers a taste of Dotabod‚Äôs Dota 2 integration (minimap blocker, basic MMR command) to compete with free bots while leaving room for upgrades. It‚Äôs minimal but functional for new streamers.
